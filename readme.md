**Project Title**  
HR-Database-MVC

**Description**  
This application uses java swing framework to create an application showing data from two tables. The UI is in hungarian language, but the code is written in english (variable and function names, etc.). The first combobox is used for filtering the data from the "EMPLOYEES" table, the second is for switching the table model from two database tables ("EMPLOYEES", "DEPARTMENTS"). The first button can modify a column data, and second one performs an update, which is needed when changing the values of the control objects (especially after sql operations). Special row sorting operations are also present.
